# Stack

A Stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations:

<strong>Push</strong>, which adds an element to the collection<br>
<strong>Pop</strong>, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (last in, first out).

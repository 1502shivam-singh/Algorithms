# Binary Search Tree

<strong>Binary Search Tree</strong> (BST), also called an ordered or sorted binary tree,<br> is a rooted binary tree whose internal nodes each store <br>a key greater than all the keys in the node's left subtree and less than those<br> in its right subtree. A binary tree is a type of data structure<br> for storing data such as numbers in an organized way.

Binary search trees allow binary search for fast lookup, addition<br> and removal of data items, and can be used <br>to implement dynamic sets and lookup tables. The order of nodes in a BST<br> means that each comparison skips about half of the remaining tree,<br> so the whole lookup takes time proportional to the logarithm of the number<br> of items stored in the tree. This is much better than the linear time<br> required to find items by key in an (unsorted) array, but slower<br> than the corresponding operations on <strong>hash tables</strong>.

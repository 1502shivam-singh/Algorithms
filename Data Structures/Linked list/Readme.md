# Linked list

A <strong>linked list</strong> is a linear collection of data elements, <br>whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. <br>Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure<br> consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.<br> In its most basic form, each node contains: data, and a reference (in other words, a link)<br> to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion<br> or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration.<br> More complex variants add additional links, allowing more efficient insertion<br> or removal of nodes at arbitrary positions.

<strong>A drawback of linked lists is that access time is linear (and difficult to pipeline).<br> Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible.</strong> Arrays have <br>better cache locality compared to linked lists.

# Graph

In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a <strong>graph</strong> is a structure<br> amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense "related".<br> The objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called vertices (also called nodes or points)<br> and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an edge (also called link or line).<br> Typically, a graph is depicted in diagrammatic form as a set of dots or circles <br>for the vertices, joined by lines or curves for the edges. Graphs are one of the objects of study in discrete mathematics.

The edges may be directed or undirected.

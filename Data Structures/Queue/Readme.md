# Queue

<strong>Queue</strong> is a collection of entities that are maintained<br> in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities<br> at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end<br> of the sequence. By convention, the end of the sequence at which elements<br> are added is called the back, tail, or rear of the queue,<br> and the end at which elements are removed is called the head or <br>front of the queue, analogously to the words used when <br>people line up to wait for goods or services.

The operation of adding an element to the rear of the queue is known as <strong>enqueue</strong>,<br> and the operation of removing an element from the front is<br> known as <strong>dequeue</strong>. Other operations may also be allowed, often including a peek<br> or front operation that returns the value of the next <br>element to be dequeued without dequeuing it.

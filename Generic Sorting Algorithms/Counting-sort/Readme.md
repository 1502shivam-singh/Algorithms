# Counting-sort

A Sorting algorithm can sort arrays in linear time. This algorithm doesn't do comparisons for sorting the entered data structures, instead it counts the repetitions and number of elements lesser than the selected element and then gives us the position of that element.

The neccesary point in this algorithm (and other non-comparison sorts) is that it uses extra space in form of two store arrays, one for keeping track of count and other for storing output.

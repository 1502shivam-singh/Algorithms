# Quicksort - Randomized

This version of quicksort is asympotically better than the normal quicksort algorithm, as it tends to take a randomized approach in deciding the pivot in each turn of the recursion. This way we can say the permutations obtained after are equally likely, so increasing the chance of a good split.

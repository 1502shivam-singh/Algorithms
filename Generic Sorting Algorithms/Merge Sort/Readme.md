# Merge Sort 

implemented from scratch -

A great example for understanding the Divide and Conquer Paradigm 
This sort comprises of two main functions Mergesort and Merge.

 (1) Mergesort function divides the list into two parts on every turn.
      
     void mergesort(std::vector<int>&,int,int);

 (2) Merge function combines the divided lists.

    void merge(int, int, int, std::vector<int>& );
